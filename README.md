## Motivation

This project was originally inspired by computerphiles video on maze solving by Dr. Mike Pound (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI). While looking into the project I also came across Cl√©ment Mihailescu project on pathfinding (https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer).

I wanted to work with maze solving algorithms to dust off my algorithim knowledge as well practice using hooks in react. If for some reason I was developing a maze solving program for work I would not use reactjs for the rendering of the maze/grid. There are too many state changes required that would is better suited to vanilla js (If I am wrong and there's a better way to go about this in react please let me know or lodge a PR!).
